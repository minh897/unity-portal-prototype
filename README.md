# Portal Prototype
An example of replicating portal visual effects in Unity

## Overview
This is just a small experimental project that I've done in my free time. The goal is replicating portal visuals with a basic teleportation logic in Unity Engine. The techniques I used to achieve this include: stencil buffer, screenspace texture sampling, oblique projection and local to world space transformation.

## Technical Breakdown
- **Rendering:** Each portal has a camera rendering the scene from its perspective with position and orientation relative to the player's camera. The output is projected onto the portal surface via a Render Texture. 

- **Teleportation logic:** Custom plane-crossing detection for Player within the portal's threshold using dot product checks for accurate direction-based teleportation.

- **Stencil masking:** Stencil buffer is used to hide geometry outside of portal bounds, avoiding rendering artifacts and visual overlap.

- **Oblique Projection:** The portal camera uses a custom oblique matrix to align its near clip plane with the portal surface, preventing visual clipping when close to the portal.

## Limitations && Future Improvements
Below are some of the limitations and possible improvements that I can think of on top of my head:

- **Player movement stutters occasionally.**  
  The current movement system can feel rough, especially during tight turns or portal transitions.  
  ➤ *Improvement:* Use `Vector3.SmoothDamp` to interpolate movement for smoother velocity transitions.

- **Teleportation feels abrupt and breaks immersion.**  
  The player visually “pops” out of the destination portal, reducing the illusion of seamless traversal.  
  ➤ *Improvement:* Use a clipping plane and spawn a mirrored player clone at the destination portal, similar to how portal cameras are handled.

- **Only the player can teleport.**  
  Objects like cubes or physics bodies pass through portals without interaction.  
  ➤ *Improvement:* Create a teleportable object base class. Track all eligible objects entering the portal and teleport them using a queue or list system.

- **Velocity resets on teleport.**  
  Teleported objects lose momentum because their transform is directly modified.  
  ➤ *Improvement:* Record velocity just before teleport and re-apply it (mirrored appropriately) on the other side.

- **Recursive portals are not handled.**  
  Portals can see each other, but rendering recursion creates visual bugs or infinite projection.  
  ➤ *Improvement:* Implement limited recursion with layered cameras and control depth of render passes. *(This is complex and currently unimplemented.)*
